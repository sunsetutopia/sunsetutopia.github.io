Dee and I have set up a blog site for our travel, so everyone doesn't get sick
of us spamming facebook all the time.

Our current plans are to go overland from SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil to Bogotoa in
Colombia, then see Spain and Portugal, a quick trip to Oktoberfest in Munich,
a two week tour of Morocco, through Central America from Mexico to Panama
(includig Cuba), and then around South East Asia for as long as our money lasts.
