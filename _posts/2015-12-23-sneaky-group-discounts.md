title: Sneaky discounts for multiple people

Many companies provide discounts for large groups, but there are ways you can get some for just two people as well, if you look.
Recently I booked two seats with PeruHop for our trip, and when you book you get a discount code that you can use for
booking on their Bolivian route, or give to a friend to use in Peru as well. Instead of booking two seats, if I had booked only
one and then used that discount code to book Dee's, it would have saved us $US10. Not much, but every bit helps.

We have been booking a few trips through TourRadar, partially because of their referral system. When you sign up using
a referral code from someone else, you get a 5% discount and they get credit for 5% of the trips you book. Not just the
first trip, all future trips too! So you should [have one person sign up](https://www.tourradar.com/invite/sunsetutopia)
(using my referral obviously :), then have them refer a second person in your group. Book your tour for all of you
except one using the second person, which will give plenty of credits to your first person. Then book the last tour
using that first person to use up all your credit. Sneaky, but not against the rules since there are actually
real people - so the same as referring friends.
