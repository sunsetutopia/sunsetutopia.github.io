Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, dingggggggg…. "Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Virgin Australia Lounge, passengers travelling blah blah blah".

After a hectic few weeks, we’ve made it to the Virgin Australia Lounge thanks to James' expertise in duping the system with the credit cards, frequent flyer points and who knows what else. We've got champagne and beer in our hands; we are now both finally on our trip of a lifetime.

The last few weeks have been filled with mixed emotions: stress, worry, excitement, happiness, anticipation, trepidation and all of the other things ending in "-ation". Our apartment has been rented out, everything we own is in storage/Vinnies/or at Ruth and Chris’ place, Wills and EPoA’s are pretty well sorted and we’ve been to the doctor for what seems to be a million injections/tablets/lectures, Thursday the beloved Commodore (Lady Rorange as Dee likes to call it) was sold; the final piece fell into place when we both closed our Commonwealth Bank accounts, at this point we both realised we’d been with CBA since kids with a Dollarmite account. This morning everything really hit home when we packed the last bits and pieces, the last box to go into storage, dropping into Dee’s Pa’s place to say goodbye and saying farewell to Maundrell Terrace.

We’re now onto the official "Farewell Tour" around the country. First stop: Canberra!
